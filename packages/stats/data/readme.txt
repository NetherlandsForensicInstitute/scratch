General:
- Glock firearms
- Fiocchi bullets
- single (different source) comparison per weapon combination
- same datasets as used in Scratch publication (2023)

Per dataset:
- firing_pin_impression
	* NL = slagpinindruk
	* 196 common source / km / H1
	* 530 different source / knm / H0 / H2
- breech_face_impression
	* NL = stootbodemindruk
	* 188 common source / km / H1
	* 1327 different source / knm / H0 / H2
- aperture_shear
	* NL = slagpingatschaaf
	* 199 common source / km / H1
	* 19701 different source / knm / H0 / H2
	
Splits (at weapon level, so not at comparision/score level):
- t = training set (both weapons in training set)
- v = validation set (both weapons in validation set)
- n = not used (one weapon in training set, other weapon in validation set)
